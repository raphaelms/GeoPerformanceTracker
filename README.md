# GPS Location Performance Tracker

This project aims to provide a database solution for storing, retrieving, and visualizing GPS locations and their associated performance metrics. Each location will belong to a group and will have multiple timeseries data representing different scores. These scores are updated irregularly and intended to be stored for multiple years, enabling us to track the performance of these locations over time.

## Features

- Create and manage a database of GPS locations with unique names and descriptions.
- Assign locations to groups, each with a name and description.
- Store multiple timeseries data for each location.
- Retrieve and calculate custom metrics for any given point in time.
- Visualize scores on a map, represented by color gradients based on the score value.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Visual Studio Code
