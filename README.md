# GeoPerformanceTracker
GeoPerformanceTracker is a project designed to collect, analyze, and visualize performance metrics for different geographical locations. We organizes locations with a time-series of performance scores. This empowers users to identify areas of high or low performance, and supporting informed decision-making to optimize outcomes.
